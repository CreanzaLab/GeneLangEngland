Data and code for the project [_Fine-scale cultural variation reinforces genetic structure in England_](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.09.23.509228 "BioRxiv pre-print").


## Data
The data includes original linguitsic data from the Survey of English Dialects (SED) that was digitized for this purpose, several features (such as rhoticity and h-dropping) that we extracted from the original data, and the code used to create these combined features from the linguistic elements.

In addition, we include the file with the data used to create our figures and develop results. For details, see paper and code. It contains:
-  the calculated lingiustic rates of change across England, based on linguistic features 
-  the calculated genetic rates of change across England, using K=2 to K=7 genetic clusters
-  the names of the clusters used in the calculations above

We do not include genetic data, as it was collected for the [People of the British Isles project](https://peopleofthebritishisles.web.ox.ac.uk). It may be requested from the Wellcome Trust.


## Code
We include the code used to generate the rates of change, to conduct analyses, and to generate figures.
